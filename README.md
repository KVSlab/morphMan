Description
-----------
morphMan (morphological manipulation) is a collection of tools for automated and objective 
manipulation and reconstruction of morphological features of patient-specific vascular geometries. 
In the tutorials we examplify the usage
by manipulating [internal carotid arteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery)
, but the tool can be applied to any geometry with a tubular shape.

The goal of morphMan is to provide research groups, and other individuals, with a set of tools to investigate the impact
of altering morphological features in patient-specific geometries. For instance, morphMan can be used to
investigate how cross-sectional area, bifurcation angles, and over all curvature change the local hemodynamics.

Installation
------------

For reference, morphMan requires the following dependencies: VTK 9.1, Numpy 1.23, SciPy 1.8.1, and VMTK 1.5.
If you are on Windows, macOS or Linux you can install all the general dependencies through `conda-forge`.
First install Anaconda or Miniconda, then add `conda-forge` to your channels with:
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `morphman` can be installed with `conda`:

```
conda create -n your_environment morphman
```

or with `mamba`:

```
mamba create -n your_environment morphman
```

You can then activate your environment with `morphman` by running 

```
source activate your_environment
```

You are now all set, and can start manipulating your geometries.
To get started, we have created some [tutorials](https://morphman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for the different modules within morphMan.
